## Exploit

Only the python compiled code will be given to the participants.
<br />

The participants will have to use a tool like uncompyle6, decompile3 etc to decompile the code.
<br />

As of now, none of the tools support python 3.9 so i have compiled the code using 3.8.9. If participants have python 3.9 they will have to create a virtual environment in which they install an older version of python to use the decompilers.
<br />

The flag is:
